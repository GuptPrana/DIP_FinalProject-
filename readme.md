ELEC4130: Course Project 

Character Recognition

Preprocessing: 
Salt and Pepper Noise
Motion Blurring
Shadow
Color scales

Image Processing:

-Binarization: Using Adaptive Filtering (Gaussian) for shadow removal. Noise removal and deblurring needed before application. Otsu thresholding rejected
 since it makes shadows worse.
 
-Text Segmentation: Currently only able to separate letters using contours. Words and lines cannot be identified.
